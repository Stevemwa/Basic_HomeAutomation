# Basic_HomeAutomation
This is an embedded system to automate redundant processes in our houses like opening doors and opening curtain 

The project could include the following features:

A keypad interface for entering passwords to access the system.
An LCD screen for displaying system status, such as the current temperature, humidity, and which appliances are currently turned on/off.
A DC motor to control the opening and closing of doors and windows in the home.
An encoded DC motor to control a smart lock on the front door.
A servo motor to control the angle of a camera to monitor the home environment.
A stepper motor to control the opening and closing of blinds or curtains.
Communication protocols such as I2C or SPI to interface with sensors and other devices.
The main objective of this project is to create a smart home automation system that can be easily controlled and monitored by the user, providing convenience and safety. The system can be programmed to perform various tasks, such as turning on the lights when the user enters a room, adjusting the temperature of the room based on the outside weather, and locking the front door automatically when the user leaves the house.

In terms of the code, you will need to write C code to implement the functionality of each component of the system, such as reading keypad input, displaying data on the LCD screen, and controlling the various motors. You will also need to implement the communication protocols to interface with sensors and other devices.

Overall, this project will allow you to apply your knowledge of mechatronics system programming to design and build a practical and useful system that can benefit your home and daily life.
